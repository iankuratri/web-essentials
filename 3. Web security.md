# Web security

Web security refers to protecting networks, servers, and computer systems from damage to or the theft of software, hardware, or data.

The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.

## Vulnerabilities

1. Zero Day:
   Vulnerability or exploit that is unknown today.

2. NPM Package vulnerabilities:
   Run `npm audit` in your project to find vulnerabilities in open source packages you are using.

   How to protect?

   Update your packages if there are any vulnerabilities.

3. Cross-site scripting (XSS):
   It is an attack in which an attacker injects malicious executable scripts into the code of a trusted application or website. Attackers often initiate an XSS attack by sending a malicious link to a user and enticing the user to click it.

   How to protect?

   - Data validation: Sanitize the incoming data.
   - Sanitize third party HTML:
     In react use dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute,
     In angular use DomSanitizer class and its methods.

4. SQL Injection:
   It is a code injection technique that might destroy your database. SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input.

   How to protect?

   - Validate inputs before form submission.

5. Preventing Data & Credential Leakage:
   Data leakage is one of the most significant threats to organizations because it gives threat actors instant access to sensitive data or internal systems.

   How to protect?

   - Never store Private keys on frontend, Always store public keys in environment variables, instead of hardcoding in your code.
   - Use tools like GitGuardian to detect if you have pushed any sensitive environment variable to Github.

6. Authentication and Authorization:
   Authentication is the process of verifying who someone is, whereas authorization is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to.

   How to protect?

   - Do not store JWT, Auth, Session token in database, reduce expiry to 15 minutes only.
   - Create a refresh token with bigger expiry time and use it for getting a new JWT, Auth, Session token.
   - Use SameSite cookies, the main goal is to mitigate the risk of cross-origin information leakage.

7. DDOS Attack (Distributed Denial-of-Service):
   It is a cybercrime in which the attacker floods a server with internet traffic to prevent users from accessing connected online services and sites.

   How to protect?

   - Using CDN (Content delivery network).
   - Google cloud armour.

8. Man in the middle (MITM) attack:
   A man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack is a type of cyber attack in which the attacker secretly intercepts and relays messages between two parties who believe they are communicating directly with each other.

   How to protect?

   - Use HTTPS protocol instead of HTTP.
   - Encrypt and Decrypt data of Request and Response respectively.
   - Use SameSite cookies, the main goal is to mitigate the risk of cross-origin information leakage.

9. Don't put anything sensitive in JWT tokens.
