# Web accessibility (a11y)

Web accessibility is the practice of making websites usable for all visitors, including those with disabilities, impairments, and limitations.

## Guides:

ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)
[https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/]

ARIA states and properties
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes]

## ARIA attributes:

aria-label:
The aria-label attribute defines a string value that labels an interactive element.

aria-labelledby:
The aria-labelledby attribute identifies the element (or elements) that labels the element it is applied to.

aria-description:
The global aria-description attribute defines a string value that describes or annotates the current element.

aria-required:
The aria-required attribute indicates that user input is required on the element before a form may be submitted.

aria-disabled:
The aria-disabled state indicates that the element is perceivable but disabled, so it is not editable or otherwise operable.

## How to optimise?

1. Semantic HTML:
   Use proper HTML elements to structure your content. This helps assistive technologies like screen readers interpret and convey information accurately. For example, use headings (h1, h2, h3, etc.) to create a logical content hierarchy.

2. Alternative Text for Images:
   Provide descriptive alt text for images. This allows users with visual impairments to understand the content of images. Alt text should be concise and convey the essential information.

3. Keyboard Accessibility:
   Ensure that all interactive elements on your site can be accessed and operated using a keyboard. This is crucial for individuals who cannot use a mouse.

   Make sure to add tabindex="0" to actionable HTML elements and tabindex="-1" to non actionable elements.
   You can also define the order by the value of the number, tabindex="0" tabindex="1" tabindex="2"

4. Focus Indicator:
   Make sure there is a visible and clear focus indicator for interactive elements when they are selected with a keyboard. This helps users understand where they are on the page.

   Like outline on button and form elements.

5. Color Contrast:
   Maintain sufficient contrast between text and background colors to ensure readability for users with low vision or color blindness.

   Color contrast ratio should be less than 4.5 between background and foreground color.

6. Descriptive Link Text:
   Use descriptive and meaningful link text instead of generic terms like "click here" or "read more." This helps users understand the purpose of the link.

7. Video and Audio Accessibility:
   Provide captions and transcripts for videos and audio content. This benefits users who are deaf or hard of hearing.

8. Responsive Design:
   Ensure that your website is responsive and adaptable to various screen sizes and devices. Test your site on different devices and browsers.

9. Aria Roles and Attributes:
   Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and attributes to enhance the accessibility of dynamic and interactive content. ARIA can help provide additional information to assistive technologies.

10. Testing and User Feedback:
    Regularly test your website with accessibility tools and get feedback from users with disabilities. This can help you identify and fix issues.

## How to measure?
